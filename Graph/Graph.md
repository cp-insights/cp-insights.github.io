## Graph

A $Graph$ is a data structure composed of $nodes$ and $edges$. 
A $Node$ is a finite set of vertices. 
A $Edge$ is an ordered pair of vertices 
of the form $(u, v)$.

A $directed\ graph$ is a graph which contains $directed\ edges$. 
A $directed\ edge$ is an ordered pair
$(u, v)$ which represents an edge in the direction from $u$ to $v$.
An $undirected\ graph$ is a graph which contains %undirected\ edges$.
An $undirected\ edge$ is a pair
$(u, v)$ which represents an edge in from $u$ to $v$ and $v$ to $u$. 
The $undirected\ edges\ (u, v)$ 
and $(v, u)$ are identical.

A $weighted\ graph$ is a graph with $weighted\ edges$.
A $weighted\ edge$ is a triplet 
$(u, v, w)$ which represents an edge from $u$ to $v$ having a weight/cost/value of $w$.
A $vertex\ labelled\ graph$ is a graph in which consists of $labelled\ vertices$.
A $labelled\ vertex$ is a vertex $u$ with an associated label/value $x$.

A $cyclic\ graph$ is a $directed\ graph$ with at least one $cycle$.
A $cycle$ is a path along $directed\ edges$ from a $vertex$ to itself.
A $directed\ acyclic\ graph$, commonly known as $DAG$ is a graph without cycle. 
A $tree$ is a type of $directed\ acyclic\ graph$.
